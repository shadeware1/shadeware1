## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

About me - I'm American and I want to make advanced American-made software because I'm tired of everything being Chinese. 
That sounds...

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a ton of projects
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cyber weapon development.

- âš¡ Projects:

AzureOS - Stripped custom version of Windows 11. Like Arch to BlackArch, Windows 11 to AzureOS.
FlokiOS - Custom OS
HermesOS - Like Arch to BlackArch, FlokiOS to HermesOS.
Mint Script - Custom coding language to make programs secure. 
Starshell - Easy integrated cybersecurity terminal suite.
iOS Analyzer - A tool for reverse engineering iOS 18 and testing and running code on it.
VSWinLX - A in progress project to get Visual Studio 2022 working native on my custom OS.
Void 512 - A ridiculous super secure wuantum resistant local drive & file manager.
snoopy - A gelocation to IP, MAC and meta data extraction.
minuteman - A windows exploit in the graphics loading system.
XSNetwork - A router management offensive security tool.
